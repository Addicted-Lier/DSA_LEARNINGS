🎯 Now your doubt:
👉 Why does LeetCode use class Solution?

Because LeetCode wants everything packed nicely in one container.

Instead of writing:

vector<int> twoSum(...)


They want:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(...)
};


So their system can create your object and call your function.



💡 Analogy (super beginner friendly)

Imagine:

Restaurant = class
Cook = function
Ingredients = variables

class Solution = a container
twoSum = function inside the container
