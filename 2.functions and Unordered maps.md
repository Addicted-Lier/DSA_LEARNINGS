vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target)


Every function has 3 things:

Return Type  Function Name  Inputs
int add(int a, int b)

Meaning:

return type → int

function name → add

inputs → a and b


---> vector<int>& nums   → the array
    int target          → the number we want


    
🧠 Why & here?
vector<int>& nums


means:

👉 Do NOT copy the array
👉 Use original
👉 faster
👉 saves memory

🎯 So full English meaning:
twoSum takes an array and a target,
and returns a list of indices.


Meaning of this line
unordered_map<int, int> numMap;


Break it:

Part	Meaning
unordered_map	fast lookup box
first int	key type
second int	value type
numMap	variable name

🧠 Why do we need it?

Because we want to quickly ask:

Have I seen this number before??


If yes → map tells index in O(1) ⚡

Without map → we search whole array → slow.


for 2sum 

🧪 Let’s replay your example
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9

i = 0

complement = 7
not found

So we store:

2 → 0

i = 1

complement = 2
FOUND ✅
We hit:
return {0, 1};

🧩 Example
Suppose map is:
{
  2 : 0,
  7 : 1
}
If:
complement = 2
Then:
numMap[2] = 0

map[key] → value

numMap.end()
🧠 What is end() ?
🎯 Visualize a map

Suppose:

numMap =
{
  2 → 0,
  7 → 1
}


Imagine items are in memory like:

[ 2→0 ] [ 7→1 ] [ ??? ]
                     ↑
                   end()


end() is pointing after last element.

🧠 What is an Iterator?

An iterator is like a smart pointer that tells you:

👉 where you are inside a container
👉 and lets you access the data there


Think of it as a bookmark 🔖 in a book.

It does NOT contain the data.
It points to the data.


⚡ Tiny analogy

Imagine:

Teacher searches for your name.

If she reaches end of register → not found.

If she stops before end → found.
